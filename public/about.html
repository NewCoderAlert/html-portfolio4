<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my page! I'd like to start by giving a short introduction. I am 35 and married with children.
  I currently work at a place that has a rat problem and is overrun by homeless most nights..I could create a whole blog on the things that go on at that place..more on that later.
</p>

<p>I recently signed up for a year of Udemy and I have been loving it. It lets me explore so many topics and the possibilities
  seem endless. I am trying to find something I can tolerate, or perhaps even love, for the rest of my working life. 
  The job I have now just isn't it. I did a search of high paying jobs and website development is one of the tops. This is 
  my way of introducing myself to it and seeing if I enjoy this enough or am smart enough to grasp all of it before putting
  money in to this for training and degrees. So far, it's not too bad. 
</p>

<p>Join me on this journey of figuring out what the heck I want to be when I grow up. I look forward to watching the growth
  and experiencing some self awareness along the way. I can't wait to create my own website!! </p>
